## Let's Talk About UI
Before creating the UI, I focused on the Emphasis of User-Interaction and the application.
> Good Experience = Good Interaction

While creating the UI for the Application at the starting point, I am just having the basic idea of, How the UI going be to look at the end ? So I drew my basic idea on a paper, would like to share with you.

The above page contains the whole idea of my Application **Covid-19 Global Mapper**.

Since **Colors** is very important because it elevates what is it that we are trying to convey to the users.
**Colors** do a lot of work visually.
